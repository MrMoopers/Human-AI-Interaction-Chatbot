The RPGAI system operates as a console application, designed to simulate a Text-Based Role-playing game adventure 
 through a variety of techniques.

The system starts by providing a description of the setting asks the user's character name. The name is compared against 
 an NLTK dataset of valid names. A valid name passes which is used for the identity management system in later sections.

Intent matching is used in an illusion of choice to acertain the direction the user chooses to go in. 
Each option reveals different text.
